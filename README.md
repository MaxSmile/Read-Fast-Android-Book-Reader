# Read Fast - Android Book Reader

## Introduction
Welcome to Read Fast, an enhanced e-book reader designed to help you train and improve your speed reading skills. 
This project is an open-source rework of the well-known Android Book Reader, tailored to provide you with the tools necessary to read faster without sacrificing comprehension.

## Goal
Our aim is to create an app that not only serves as a comfortable e-book reader but also doubles as a personal reading coach, 
helping you break through your current reading speed limits. Whether you're a student looking to study more efficiently, 
a professional needing to quickly digest extensive reports, or simply a book lover wanting to get through your reading list faster, Read Fast is here for you.

## Features to achieve
- **Speed Reading Techniques**: Incorporates training methods and exercises to practice and master speed reading.
- **Customizable Settings**: Offers a personalized reading experience by allowing you to adjust reading speed, font size, and more.
- **Text Highlighting**: Features guided reading with highlighted text to promote a quicker pace and aid in visual tracking.
- **Progress Tracking**: Logs your reading sessions, enabling you to monitor your progress and see how your reading speed improves over time.

## Open Source Contribution
Read Fast is a community-driven project, and contributions are warmly welcomed. Whether it's through improving the codebase, designing user interfaces, or documenting, every bit of help is invaluable.
